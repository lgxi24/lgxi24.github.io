Hi, welcome to my homepage! :wave:

My name is Guanxi Lu. Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London. My experience spans multiple disciplines, including computer architecture, FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array), and machine learning.

Currently, my research interests focus on efficient LLM inference.
You can check out my [Portfolio](/portfolio/) to see some of my experiences.
